Every single play, your facial emotion will be *randomly* matched with **block types**. Besides, you have to control your emotion to manage **block speed**!

| Emotion   | Speed |
|-----------|-------|
| Happy     | 1     |
| Surprised | 2     |
| Angry     | 3     |
| Others    | 4     |
| Neutral   | 5     |

## Quick start
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to play
1. Run `main.py`
2. Read matched **Emotion : Block type** below your screen.
   1. Emotion and block type will be randomly matched
   2. Don't be worry! Match between emotion and block speed is fixed.
3. Be emotive to manage next block type and speed.
4. Cheer up!

### Tips for Newbies
- Be **emotive**! Because *neutral* state will drop your blocks really quick.
- **Smile** while you planning strategy! Because *happy* status will drop your blocks slowly.
