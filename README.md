Every single play, your facial expressions will be *randomly* matched with **block types**. Besides, you have to control your facial expressions to manage the **block speed**!

| Emotion   | Speed |
|-----------|-------|
| Happy     | 1     |
| Surprised | 2     |
| Angry     | 3     |
| Others    | 4     |
| Neutral   | 5     |

   1. Emotions and block types will be randomly matched.
   2. Don't worry! The emotion&speed relation is always the same. Just the block types are changing each round!
